## Project Description

The project focuses on the design and simulation of solar stills, which are devices used to distill water using solar energy. This repository includes detailed Blender models for visualizing the rectangular and spherical configurations of solar stills, as well as an extensive report detailing the study's findings.

## Files Included

- **Solar Still**: Blender file for the solar still simulation.
- **Spherical Solar Still**: Blender file for the spherical solar still simulation.
- **Study Report**: A PDF document providing a complete report of the study related to solar stills.

## Installation

To work with the Blender files, you will need to have [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) installed on your system. Download and install Blender from the official website.

---

## Usage

1. Open the respective Blender file (`solar_still.blend` or `spherical_solar_still.blend`) in Blender.
2. Explore the 3D models and simulations.
3. Refer to the PDF report for detailed information about the study and findings.
